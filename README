# Autoencoders for Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project applies deep learning autoencoders for anomaly detection in financial datasets, focusing on identifying fraudulent transactions. The approach leverages unsupervised neural networks to uncover subtle irregularities in transactional data.

## Features
- Built with Python and TensorFlow/Keras
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for financial time series
- Model construction and training pipeline for autoencoders
- Evaluation with ROC, AUC, and confusion matrices
- Visualization of reconstruction errors and anomaly scores

## Usage
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Prepare your dataset in the `/data` folder
3. Train the model with `python train_autoencoder.py`
4. Analyze results with provided notebooks and scripts

## Applications
- Financial fraud detection
- Credit card fraud analysis
- Generalizable anomaly detection in feature-rich time series
